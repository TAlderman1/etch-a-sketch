Vanilla JS Etch-A-Sketch project.

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming languages.

The Etch-A-Sketch tool will relay a "sketch" based on mouseover event, and will "log" the user's input by changing elements' background color attributes.

This leaves the user with a "sketch" at the end of their session, which they can then clear and start again using the "Clear Sketch" button.

The user is also offered the ability to input the number of boxes/elements in the grid.  This will impact the size of the elements as they change color, however it will not effect the size of the grid overall.

First project built from scratch with no help/tutorials.
